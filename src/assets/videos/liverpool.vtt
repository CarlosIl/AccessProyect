1
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.720
Bajcetic...

2
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.400
And across goal towards Gakpo!

3
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.760
Iwobi with the corner, very deep
round the back towards Tarkowski!

4
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
Who's denied by the woodwork,
and Liverpool survive.

5
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.920
Now Nunez, and Liverpool's counter-attack.

6
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.840
Red shirts flooding forward -

7
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.280
and it's Salah, goal!

8
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.960
Oh, beautiful finish, Liverpool take the ball
from one end of the field to the other.

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.200
And Mohamed Salah as always
is the first to get there.

10
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.160
- At one end Tarkowski thinks
he's got the opening goal in the derby,

11
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.360
but it's all about the delivery, and it's
a lovely little ball into the path of Salah.

12
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.160
- That's brilliant from Robertson, who's just
opened the game up for Liverpool.

13
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.520
Salah, Alexander-Arnold...

14
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
Beautiful ball across goal!

15
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.400
Cody Gakpo has scored his first goal
for Liverpool

16
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.200
and given them clear daylight
in the Merseyside derby.

17
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.880
You can just sense the relief round Anfield.

18
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.840
Two big counter-attacks from Liverpool,
two goals for Liverpool.

19
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.560
Lovely ball by Alexander-Arnold,

20
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.640
Salah, Nunez, and still!

21
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.160
And again!

22
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.440
Pickford did enough.

23
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
That's a lovely take by Firmino.

24
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.520
Salah, glorious,
can he wrap it up for Liverpool?

25
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.000
It's a very good save by Pickford.
